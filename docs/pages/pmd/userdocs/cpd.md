title: Finding duplicated code
summary: Or how to find copied and pasted code

## Overview

Duplicate code can be hard to find, especially in a large project.
But PMD's Copy/Paste Detector (CPD) can find it for you!
CPD has been through three major incarnations:

*   First we wrote it using a variant of Michael Wise's Greedy String Tiling algorithm (our variant is described
    [here](http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2003/03/12/pmd_cpd.html)).

*   Then it was completely rewritten by Brian Ewins using the
    [Burrows-Wheeler transform](http://dogma.net/markn/articles/bwt/bwt.htm).

*   Finally, it was rewritten by Steve Hawkins to use the
    [Karp-Rabin](http://www.nist.gov/dads/HTML/karpRabin.html) string matching algorithm.

Each rewrite made it much faster, and now it can process the JDK 1.4 java.* packages in about 4 seconds
(on my workstation, at least).

Note that CPD works with Java, JSP, C, C++, C#, Fortran and PHP code and some more languages. For the
full list, see below [Supported Languages](#supported-languages).

Your own language is missing?
See how to add it [here](/pmd_devdocs_adding_new_cpd_language.html).

CPD is included with PMD, which you can download [here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pmd/files/pmd/).

## Command line usage

### Windows

CPD comes with its own starter batch file: `cpd.bat`. It's located in the `bin` subdirectory in the PMD
binary distribution zip-file. Let's assume, you are in this directory, then you can start CPD this way:

    cpd.bat --minimum-tokens 100 --files c:\temp\src\java

The options "minimum-tokens" and "files" are the two required options; there are more options, see below.


### Linux

For Linux, there is since PMD 5.0 a combined start script for all command line tools. This includes CPD.
The start script is called `run.sh` and is located in the `bin` subdirectory in the PMD binary distribution
zip-file. Let's assume, you are in this directory, then you can start CPD this way:

    ./run.sh cpd --minimum-tokens 100 --files /tmp/src/java

The options "minimum-tokens" and "files" are the two required options; there are more options, see below.

### Examples

_Note:_ The following example use the Linux start script. For Windows, just replace "./run.sh cpd" by "cpd.bat".


Minimum required options: Just give it the minimum duplicate size and the source directory:

    $ ./run.sh cpd --minimum-tokens 100 --files /usr/local/java/src/java

You can also specify the language:

    $ ./run.sh cpd --minimum-tokens 100 --files /path/to/c/source --language cpp

You may wish to check sources that are stored in different directories:

    $ ./run.sh cpd --minimum-tokens 100 --files /path/to/other/source  --files /path/to/other/source --files /path/to/other/source --language fortran

<em>There should be no limit to the number of '--files', you may add... But if you stumble one, please tell us !</em>

And if you're checking a C source tree with duplicate files in different architecture directories
you can skip those using --skip-duplicate-files:

    $ ./run.sh cpd --minimum-tokens 100 --files /path/to/c/source --language cpp --skip-duplicate-files

You can also specify the encoding to use when parsing files:

    $ ./run.sh cpd --minimum-tokens 100 --files /usr/local/java/src/java --encoding utf-16le

You can also specify a report format - here we're using the XML report:

    $ ./run.sh cpd --minimum-tokens 100 --files /usr/local/java/src/java --format xml

The default format is a text report, and there's also a `csv` report.

Note that CPD is pretty memory-hungry; you may need to give Java more memory to run it, like this:

    $ export HEAPSIZE=512m
    $ ./run.sh cpd --minimum-tokens 100 --files /usr/local/java/src/java

In order to change the heap size under Windows, you'll need to edit the batch file `cpd.bat` set the "OPTS"
variable to `-Xmx512m`.


If you specify a source directory but don't want to scan the sub-directories, you can use the non-recursive option:

    $ ./run.sh cpd --minimum-tokens 100 --non-recursive --files /usr/local/java/src/java

### Exit status

Please note that if CPD detects duplicated source code, it will exit with status 4 (since 5.0).
This behavior has been introduced to ease CPD integration into scripts or hooks, such as SVN hooks.

<table>
<tr><td>0</td><td>Everything is fine, now code duplications found</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>Couldn't understand command line parameters or CPD exited with an exception</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>At least one code duplication has been detected unless '--failOnViolation false' is used.</td></tr>

## Ant task

Andy Glover wrote an Ant task for CPD; here's how to use it:

    <target name="cpd">
        <taskdef name="cpd" classname="net.sourceforge.pmd.cpd.CPDTask" />
        <cpd minimumTokenCount="100" outputFile="/home/tom/cpd.txt">
            <fileset dir="/home/tom/tmp/ant">
                <include name="**/*.java"/>
            </fileset>
        </cpd>
    </target>

<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0">
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><b>Attribute</b></td>
    <td valign="top"><b>Description</b></td>
    <td valign="top"><b>Applies for language</b></td>
    <td align="center" valign="top"><b>Required</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">encoding</td>
    <td valign="top">
        The character set encoding (e.g., UTF-8) to use when reading the source code files, but also when
        producing the report. A piece of warning, even if you set properly the encoding value,
        let's say to UTF-8, but you are running CPD encoded with CP1252, you may end up with not UTF-8 file.
        Indeed, CPD copy piece of source code in its report directly, therefore, the source files
        keep their encoding.<br />
        If not specified, CPD uses the system default encoding.

        then switch it on to see what it turns up; defaults to `false`.

        and Spring (everything) annotations become very redundant. Often classes or methods have the
        same 5-6 lines of annotations. This causes false positives; defaults to `false`.

  </tr>
</table>

Also, you can get verbose output from this task by running ant with the `-v` flag; i.e.:

    ant -v -f mybuildfile.xml cpd

Also, you can get an HTML report from CPD by using the XSLT script in pmd/etc/xslt/cpdhtml.xslt.  Just run
the CPD task as usual and right after it invoke the Ant XSLT script like this:

    <xslt in="cpd.xml" style="etc/xslt/cpdhtml.xslt" out="cpd.html" />

## GUI

CPD also comes with a simple GUI. You can start it via some scripts in the `bin` folder:

For Windows:

    cpdgui.bat

For Linux:

    ./run.sh cpdgui

Here's a screenshot of CPD after running on the JDK 8 java.lang package:

## Suppression

Arbitrary blocks of code can be ignored through comments on **Java** by including the keywords `CPD-OFF` and `CPD-ON`.

    public Object someParameterizedFactoryMethod(int x) throws Exception {
        // some unignored code

        // tell cpd to start ignoring code - CPD-OFF

        // mission critical code, manually loop unroll
        goDoSomethingAwesome(x + x / 2);
        goDoSomethingAwesome(x + x / 2);
        goDoSomethingAwesome(x + x / 2);
        goDoSomethingAwesome(x + x / 2);
        goDoSomethingAwesome(x + x / 2);
        goDoSomethingAwesome(x + x / 2);

        // resume CPD analysis - CPD-ON

        // further code will *not* be ignored
    }


Additionally, **Java** allows to toggle suppression by adding the annotations
**`@SuppressWarnings("CPD-START")`** and **`@SuppressWarnings("CPD-END")`**
all code within will be ignored by CPD.

This approach however, is limited to the locations were `@SuppressWarnings` is accepted.
It's legacy and the new comment's based approch should be favored.

    //enable suppression
    @SuppressWarnings("CPD-START")
    public Object someParameterizedFactoryMethod(int x) throws Exception {
        // any code here will be ignored for the duplication detection
    }
    //disable suppression
    @SuppressWarnings("CPD-END)
    public void nextMethod() {
    }


Other languages currently have no support to suppress CPD reports. In the future,
the comment based approach will be extended to those of them that can support it.
