**PMD** scans source code in Java and other languages and looks for potential problems like:

*   Possible bugs - empty try/catch/finally/switch statements
*   Dead code - unused local variables, parameters and private methods
*   Suboptimal code - wasteful String/StringBuffer usage
*   Overcomplicated expressions - unnecessary if statements, for loops that could be while loops

**CPD**, the copy-paste-detector, finds duplicated code in many languages:

*   Duplicate code is often just copied and pasted. This means, the bugs are also copied and pasted. Fixing
    them means, fix all duplicated code locations.
